This directory holds Zabbix translations and helper scripts to work with them.

If you have checked out this copy of frontend from svn and want to access
 translations, run make_mo.sh .

Working msgfmt and find are required. This script will generate mo files for all
 translations.

If you want to update po files with new strings in the sourcefile, run
 update_po.sh . If those strings are in a file that previously did not have any
 translatable strings, add them to POTFILES.in first.

If you want to start translating in a new language, run add_new_language.sh and
 pass language code as the only argument, for example:

  $ ./add_new_language.sh et

For this script language template is needed. Run update_po.sh to generate one.
