ZABBIX 1.1:

 - RPM for RedHat EL
 - get rid of extra warning messages in W32 agent
 - escalation
 - execution of commands on monitored hosts in case of pre-defined events
 - repeated notifications
 - monitoring of log files
 - audit log
 - anvanced SNMP trapper
 - hard-linked templates
 - passing of parameters to user-defined commands (agent)
 - more supported parameters under FreeBSD, HP-UX and Solaris (cpu times, network stats)
 - agent proxy

TKOM:

 - alarms forwarding to external systems (using SNMP traps, for example)
 - groups of graphs
 - auto-discovery script
 - alarm/trigger sounds
 - saved custom-time period in graphs and screens
 - SNMP trap processing
 - SNMP trap sending
 - wider service testing possibilities

TELECENTRS:

4. SNMP traps. Make possible action definition for the SNMP trap-related
 events.


OTHER:

 - improve temoval of item related data from history
'-' doesn't work in trigger expressions (a-b=0)

 When editing trigger actions in subject it says something
for instance "low disk space on {HOSTNAME}'s /usr"
when submitting form, it dumps mysql error, due to non-
escaped single quote. I believe all user input should be
escaped before submitting to mysql.

Escalation:
* Nabor pravil izmenenija prioriteta triggera/... s techeniem vremeni.
* Nabor pravil ustanavlivaetsja na sled.urovnjah: sistema, host, user,
trigger.
* Prioritetnostj nabrov pravil (naprimer)v porjadke ubivanija: user,
trigger, host, sistema.
* Nabor pravil ustanavlivaetsja dlja kazhdogo 'severity' otdeljno,
** prichem trigger sleduet svoemu naboru v zavisimosti ot ego originaljnogo
'severity'.

! * Ponjatie: urovenj eskalacii - skoljkim urovnjam admin.ierarhii
proishodit posil alerta - vishe originaljnogo.

Variant pravil:
* povtor alerta - zaderzhka vo vremeni: PA - proishodit povtor posilki
alerta ispoljzuja tekuschee znachenie 'severity' i urovnja ;
* izmenenie severity - zadaem kolichestvo PA, cherez kotoroe Severity++;
** samo soboi vishe Disaster ne stanet :)
* izmenenie urovnja eskalacii:  zadaem kolichestvo PA, cherez kotoroe
urovenj eskalacii++;

>  Atradu liekas, ka vienu bug: tad, ja updeito Host statusu zem Host, tad trigeris par "Host unreachable" pazuud, jo ir statusaa "unknown", bet pie alarms neparaadas
>, ka tas buutu mainijis savu statusu.

 - negative values in graphs
 - add tabs to all screens where required
 - check all screens if they are user friendly and present information in the best possible way
 - possibility (a button) to recheck unsupported parameters
 - add advanced task scheduler/executor to ZABBIX
 - agent incorrectly returns amount of free/available memory on HP-UX (must be 24GB)
 - add failure (timeouts, network errors, etc) reasons to items and hosts
 - get rid of net[listen_*] in templates
 - use assert() for critical functions
 - check if simple checks  (FTP, SMTP!) works correctly when host name (not IP) is used
I found that if I use the fully qualified name of my host, all simple checks
are working, but they failed if I simply use the hostname.

 - add icons to a map by clicking mouse
 - optionally support map generation in JPEG. PNG images are huge!
 - make w32 agent not to write warnings in case of timeout (HB)
 - security-related issues

There are still quite a few strcpy calls made against non-const user, database, or remote supplied data, in both the src/* and include/* directories.

printf calls w/o static format specifiers...
in src and include:
grep -R printf * | grep -v "\%\|Makefile\|Binary"

extensive use of atoi rather than something w/ bounds checking like strtol.

Most of the signal handlers all need to delay or block signals to avoid signal race conditions, as they call non-reentrant functions.

 - in user administration, add many resources from a list (not by one ID)
 - availability report for day/week/month/etc
 - check if items delay works
 - apply Igor patches for chart.php (calculation of MIN, MAX)
 - review PHP code for simplifying (urls, iif() )
 - fix screenedit.php permissions

 Kak naschet dopolnenij k time & date:
 * tipa weekday, month, day, year, hour, minute, ...
 * osobenno weekday polezno - dabi ne podnimatj triggeri po vihodnim :)

 Nu i k 'str' dodlstj csjakie vsjakosti tipa
 * substr, length, poisk pozicii simvola/podstroki (FIND/SEARCH v Excel),
 podscet kolichestva simvola (tipa skoljko tam zapjatih)...

 - add requirement for fping to the manual
 - separate login.php and index.php
 - add gaps to graph when no data present
 - remove icmpping and others from the QUEUE
 - escalation and repeated notifications

 - summarising report about triggers/actions/items. Show items without triggers,
trigger wihout actions, etc etc
 5) When adding trigger, next page is without triggers of this host. Is  
 it possible after adding triger to go back to triggers of this host page ?

 - zabbix thinks that host is unrechable if it receives string for numeric item

 - think about implementation of sinchronised items like cpu[usr], cpu[sys], cpu[idle]
 - check setproctitle() Lukas sent some time ago for Linux

 - implement complex SLA calculation (donwtimes, working/non-working hours), etc. See
forum Open Discussion for more info.
 - add selection of MIN/MAX/AVG for graphs
 - rewrite validation and evaluation of expressions (i.e. make >-1 work)
 - support for 'Clone' (graphs and screens)
 - add support of interface statistics under Solaris and FreeBSD
 - add screens and graphs to host templates
 - calculate MIN value for graphs (do not use '0')
 - infrastructure for reports
 - stacked graphs

 - icmppingsec->icmppingmsec
 - disk size is not correct after evaluating macros in the message
 - add support for real 'delta' (last-previous)
 - fix evaluation of complex trigger expressions (diskpercentage)
 - add support for percentages of disk usage and diskused[]
 - check if alert and service alert is added after host become reachable again
 - navigation bar for all graphs and screens
 - check bug with trapper receiving value with ":"

LATER:

 - zabbix to write log to the item (for example: log when item becomes unsupported)
 - support for UDP-based checks (DNS, etc)
 - preserve selected host group between different screens (trigger maintenance, host maintenance)
 - add zabbix[unixtime] and lastupdate() and tick() to get rid of nodata()
 - check return code for alert scripts
 - zabbix_agentd to support processor load, swap[*] and memory[*] onder AIX
 - make possible passing of parameters to user script for UserParameters
 like param[*]
 - make session expiration time configurable in config.php
 - mess with user groups when running under root
 - support for PREFIX/zabbix/etc (configuration files)
 - trapper item. Source->Alarms do not grow when last status is unknown for
latest trigger (item type  = TRAPPER)
 - SNMP traps. Condition to switch expression off. New function which would return
 status of the trigger could help. 

 - when zabbix cannot evaluate expression it does not change status to UNKNOWN but adds ALARM (UNKNOWN) 
 - preset time for graphs

 - finish src/zabbix_snmptrapper
 - links to Zabbix frontend in alert emails
 - strings items for graphs
 - UserParameter does not appear in the log
 - ability to add a library of  userwritten c-functions with dlopen/dlsym to
the agent with a predefined API that can return values to suckerd (for both 
suckerd and agentd)
 - zabbix_trapperd does not start if PostgreSQL and DBConnectOnEach=1

 - monitoring of log files
 - [10] Refresh stop ability. At least for graphs and triggers being selected.
 - [10] IT Services. Show downtimes for weeks.
 - [10] IT Services. User view, show algorithm.
 - [10] BUG. When adding new service, service name is wrong.
 - [10] IT Services. SLA for a period of time only (09:00-18:00)

 - monitoring of Windows event log

LS:

 - update trigger value immediately after add or update
 - graphs. Dobavljatj item so smescheniem vo vremeni
 - check permissions for zabbix_agentd when started under root
 - add item to group (not to all)
 - update host from template

change(N) - raznica mezhdu poslednim i na N vremeni ranee poluchennim
znacheniem;
abschange(N) = abs(change(N));

trend(N) - linejnaja aproksimacija sled.znachenija po interval vremeni N;

 - show host groups in "Status of Triggers"
 - if 'Update', then default action (button 'Enter') must be Update
 - do not check SNMP port existance if Item is not SNMP
 - host groups (delete, rename)
 - add item to host group
 - add descriptions to items
 - link host (group) to template

graphs:

 - min value (0 or automatic)
 - customisation of font size
 - link items to show them in one graph (network in/out) 

 - snmp oid symbolic representation
 - periodically check unsupported items (NxInterval). Can be configurable.
 - Latest values->Host->[Show not monitored]

HP:

 - use profiles instead of passing parameters using POST
 - add threshold,min,max line for user-defined graphs

 to the item.
 - [4] users.php. Link to page which shows all actions defined for this user.
 - [5] Configuration of items/triggers. Add Select.
 - [7] SLA algorithm (A - 0%, B - 100% -> availability of AB = 50%)
 - [7] IT Service % must start at 01.01.20xx, not first day of the week
 - [7] ALARMS. Ability to select events by specifying date from/to.

LS:

 - daily weekly monthly graphs
 - detailed description for items

TOP PRIORITY:

 - fix update of 'status'. When added it never gets updated, if server is already unreachable.
 - pay attention to Solaris agent
 - add more checks for forms (check all possible wrong values)
 - support of fetch_html[*]
 - restructure sources
 - support for automake
 - zabbix_agentd to support processor load, swap[*] and memory[*] onder AIX

BUGS:

 - add protection from IT Service looping

DIFFERENT TASKS:

 - SNMP trapping
 - distributed monitoring
 - backup/restore scripts for server. Backup all (DB, configs, etc).
 - personalisation (refresh rate, graph size, default graph period, etc)
 - SNMP-walk in WEB interface
 - add UserParameter without restart of an agent

TODO:

- Agent
 1. An API so that I can build and active agent into
    the centralized monitoring point of my application.
 2. max/min/average values during the poll pause along with last value to catch
CPU spikes otherwise invisible (have had these problems with BMC Patrol).
 3. Ability to add a library of  userwritten c-functions with dlopen/dlsym to
the agent with a predefined API that can return values to suckerd.

Not ready yet:

1. Monitoring of Windows (2000) services via SNMP
This is an extension I wrote based on your SNMP checker that scans through the Windows SNMP mib to check if a specified
+process is running. I thought it may be able to be used in a similar situation to the new SIMPLE check.

2. Basic schedule to monitor certain items during specified period.
I made changes to the PHP frontend and zabbix_sucker.c to enable the user to specify a time period (like between 9am-5pm) when
+the item should be checked.
(From: "Dave McCrudden" <dmccrudden@custcare.com.au>)


 - BUG. zabbix_sucker should accept parameter regardless of "\n" at the end of line 
 - do not send notifications at certain periods of time. Do not monitor services at certain periods of time.
 - decrease number of TCP connections between server and agent
 - add triggers for all hosts at once
 - check new Mariusz patches
 - add support for downtimes, user availablity, etc

HB:

 - BUG. history graph goes left
 - personalisation (refresh rate, graph size, default graph period, etc)

 - LDAP authorisation (should work with MSWindows LDAP)
 - Reports:
 - more customizable (graphs time range: 1 mont, etc)

WIN32 Agent:

* API for sub-agents
* Support for check_port[] parameter
* Support for check_service[] parameter
* Installation program
* Possibility to store configuration in registry
* Configuration tool (may be through MMC?)

 OTHER:

 - support for netload under other platforms
 - make kstat structure local (instead of static)
 - collect network and other statistics using kstat()
 - apply Mariusz's patches
 - support for complex reports
 - support for check_service[samba]
 - ability to execute command on server monitored
 - support for OS X (network loads, disk loads)
 - check for function parameters in evaluate_simple_expression
 - update trigger status to UNKNOWN if cannot evaluate function 

 LATER:

 - setup demo site
 - different sound files for different severity
 - think about service node types (some nodes will automatically register
  problem)
