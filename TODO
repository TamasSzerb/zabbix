HIGH PRIORITY:

 - mass updates/inserts
 - support for net-snmp
 - LDAP authorisation (should work with MSWindows LDAP)
 - get rid of long select lists in user forms 
 - do not dump "Expression cannot be evaluated" in case if function.lastvalue
   is NULL
 - support fo netload under other platforms
 - support for disk loads
 - new host name should not contain space and other character not allowed by trigger expression

TODO:

After using zabbix for a week monitoring 4 linux and 1 sun machine I have a
small wish-list:

- PHP front end
 1. Add items for all hosts at once
 2. Add triggers for all hosts at once

- Agent
 1. An API so that I can build and active agent into
    the centralized monitoring point of my application.
 2. max/min/average values during the poll pause along with last value to catch
CPU spikes otherwise invisible (have had these problems with BMC Patrol).
 3. Ability to add a library of  userwritten c-functions with dlopen/dlsym to
the agent with a predefined API that can return values to suckerd.

Not ready yet:

 - add support for downtimes, user availablity, etc
 - get rid of false warning messages (like unable to insert ...)

 HB:

 - Tree like in old Zabbix
 - SNMP trapping
 - Reports:
  - more customizable (graphs time range: 1 mont, etc)

 OTHER:

 - personalisation (refresh rate, graph size, default graph period, etc)
 - round MIN/MAX/AVG numbers for graphs
 - dashed grid somethimes is out of rectangle for graphs
 - calculate MIN value for graphs (do not use '0')
 - use JS in forms
 - make kstat structure local (instead of static)
 - collect network and other statistics using kstat()
 - apply Mariusz's patches
 - link map's line to a trigger
 - support for complex reports
 - support for check_service[samba]
 - ability to execute command on server monitored
 - support for tcp_ping[] which returns number of ms spent
 - support for OS X (network loads, disk loads)
 - agent to send something back in case of timeout (?)
 - check for function parameters in evaluate_simple_expression
 - make links different if something is already registered (as for medias,
   actions, etc)
 - update trigger status to UNKNOWN if cannot evaluate function 
 - when doing UserParameter do not return FAIL in case of timeout

 LATER:

 - IT Helpdesk
 - show who is online somewhere (in User config form?)
 - setup demo site
 - add user groups
 - look for cool icons
 - different sound files for different severity
 - distributed monitoring
 - Agent for Windows (can we use nsclient?)
 - rename "Alerts" to "Notification"
 - add numeric constants to trigger expressions
 - get rid of problems with ' and "
 - think about service node types (some nodes will automatically register
  problem)
