echo " WARNING: backup your database before performing upgrade

 This is an UNSUPPORTED Zabbix upgrade script from 1.6 to 1.8 for MySQL
 It does the following things:
  1. Drops all indexes that might have been created in Zabbix 1.6 database;
  2. Converts all tables to UTF-8;
  3. Patches the database from 1.6 schema to 1.8 schema;
  4. Adds the 'Discovered' hosts group and sets it to be used for discovered hosts.

 This script is not for distributed monitoring databases.

 Usage: pass required MySQL parameters to this script (like database, user, password etc).
