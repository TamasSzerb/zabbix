1. host-reconid-import.pl

The host-reconid-import.pl imports service recon id data from comma
delimited CSV file into corresponding host_invetory tag field in 
Zabbix. 

The CSV file format should be:
,<CI name>,<CI ReconId>,

The script sets the host_inventory tag field to <CI ReconID> for hosts
with host field matching <CI name>

The authentication data is hardcoded in $URL, $USER and $PASSWORD 
variables where:
  $URL - the Zabbix API URL - <frontend url>/api_jsonrpc.php
         (for example http://localhost/zabbix/frontends/php/api_jsonrpc.php)
  $USER - the zabbix user name (for example Admin)
  $PASSWORD - the zabbix user password (for example zabbix)

The script is written in perl and requires json and json rpc perl modules.	
To import the ReconID script run: host-reconid-import.pl <import filename>
where <import filename> is the exported ReconId data in CSV format.
