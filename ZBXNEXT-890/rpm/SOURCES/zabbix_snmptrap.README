Processing SNMP traps in Zabbix
===============================

The Zabbix source archive contains a script called snmptrapd.sh that's used
for processing of received SNMP traps in Zabbix (see Zabbix Manual for the
details [1]). I have split the script into 2 parts - one containing
configuration and second the script itself (renamed to zabbix-snmptrap).
Zabbix 1.9+ will get a new implementation of the traps processing [2], but
we should have a solution for 1.8.
