# WARNING: backup your database before performing upgrade

# This is an unsupported Zabbix upgrade script from 1.6 to 1.8 for MySQL
# It does the following things:
#  1. Drops all indexes that might have been created in Zabbix 1.6 database;
#  2. Converts all tables to UTF-8;
#  3. Patches the database from 1.6 schema to 1.8 schema.

# Usage: pass required MySQL parameters to this script (like database, user, password etc).
