ZABBIX server for Debian
-------------------------

 This zabbix-server-pgsql package will offer to create the database
 automatically during the installation. If you chose to do this step
 manually then please find the SQL scripts in /usr/share/zabbix-server.
 Please configure the database access in the /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
 so that Zabbix knows where to find the database.


Upgrading the database schema manually (MANDATORY!)
---------------------------------------------------

 THIS STEP IS MANDATORY FOR EVERYBODY WHO UPGRADES FROM <1.8 to 1.8.
 ZABBIX 1.8 WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY IF YOU IGNORE THIS SECTION.

 Unfortunately the database can not be upgraded automatically from
 Zabbix server installations earlier than 1.8 to version 1.8.
 If you are upgrading from Debian Lenny (Zabbix version 1.4) you will
 need to update from 1.4 to 1.6 first. Then do the upgrade from 1.6 to
 1.8. Sorry for the inconvenience. We tried hard to spare you this step.

 Upgrade 1.4 -> 1.6
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $> /etc/init.d/zabbix-server stop

 $> psql -h localhost zabbix zabbix \
    < /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-pgsql/examples/1.6/patch.sql

 $> /etc/init.d/zabbix-server start

 Upgrade 1.6 -> 1.8
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 $> /etc/init.d/zabbix-server stop

 $> psql -h localhost zabbix zabbix \
    < /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-pgsql/examples/1.8/patch.sql
 
 $> /etc/init.d/zabbix-server start
