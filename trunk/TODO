HIGH PRIORITY:

 - rename Show-Show-Show
 - BUG. history graph goes left
 - Graphs for specified period and date and time
 - Check Housekeeping procedure

 - fix buffer overflow in zbx_log().
* - add severity to pre-defined triggers 
* - BUG. zabbix_sucker should accept parameter regardless of "\n" at the end of line 
* - BUG. Agent return unsupported in case if UserParameter ends by timeout.
 - test everything under Explorer and Netscape. Especially Graphs,Charts and Maps.
 - mass updates/inserts (add items and triggers for all hosts at once)
* - support for net-snmp
 - get rid of long select lists in user forms 
 - better monitoring of log files
 - IT Helpdesk
 - SNMP trapping
 - personalisation (refresh rate, graph size, default graph period, etc)
* - add protection from IT Service loop
* - support of template hosts. Remove tables hosts_templates and others

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:

 - remove lastvalue, lastclock, prevvalue from table ITEMS

DIFFERENT TASKS:

 - SNMP trapping
 - SNMP v2,v3
 - auto-discovery
 - Native Windows GUI
 - distributed monitoring
 - use JS in forms
 - audit log
 - backup/restore scripts for server. Backup all (DB, configs, etc).
 - IT Helpdesk
 - monitoring of log files
 - high-performance, optimised zabbix_suckerd and zabbix_trapperd
 - personalisation (refresh rate, graph size, default graph period, etc)
 - encryption
 - automated report generation
 - SNMP-walk in WEB interface
 - add UserParameter without restart of an agent
 - write white-paper
 - prepare Power Point presentation

REGISTERED BUGS:

 - improper handling of special characters i.e. ',", etc
 - graphs and maps not displayed sometimes


TODO:

- Agent
 1. An API so that I can build and active agent into
    the centralized monitoring point of my application.
 2. max/min/average values during the poll pause along with last value to catch
CPU spikes otherwise invisible (have had these problems with BMC Patrol).
 3. Ability to add a library of  userwritten c-functions with dlopen/dlsym to
the agent with a predefined API that can return values to suckerd.

Not ready yet:

 - check Rickard's multithreaded agent
 - check new Mariusz patches
 - improve performance of Alarms and Alerts in PHP frontend
 - default user name for DB acess should be the same (root)
 - add support for downtimes, user availablity, etc
 - get rid of false warning messages (like unable to insert ...)
 - BUG. Avoid situations when PID file is not deleted.

HB:

 - Tree like in old Zabbix
 - LDAP authorisation (should work with MSWindows LDAP)
 - Reports:
 - more customizable (graphs time range: 1 mont, etc)

 WIN32 Agent:

- Support for timeout parameter
- Support for user-configurable data collection (like CPU utilization, but
  for any performance counter)
- Support for external program execution
- API for sub-agents
- Add logging to system log

 PLUS:

- Network discovery daemon (?)
- Native Windows GUI (in version 2.0 ?)
- Host templates
- Use UDP instead of TCP as transport protocol (?)
- backup/restore scripts for server. Backup all (DB, configs, etc).
- Network topology database
- Automatic network map generation from topology database
- Audit log
- Support for MD5 checksums

 OTHER:

 - support for netload under other platforms
 - support for disk loads
 - round MIN/MAX/AVG numbers for graphs
 - dashed grid somethimes is out of rectangle for graphs
 - calculate MIN value for graphs (do not use '0')
 - use JS in forms
 - make kstat structure local (instead of static)
 - collect network and other statistics using kstat()
 - apply Mariusz's patches
 - link map's line to a trigger
 - support for complex reports
 - support for check_service[samba]
 - ability to execute command on server monitored
 - support for tcp_ping[] which returns number of ms spent
 - support for OS X (network loads, disk loads)
 - check for function parameters in evaluate_simple_expression
 - make links look different if something is already registered (as for medias,
   actions, etc)
 - update trigger status to UNKNOWN if cannot evaluate function 
 - when doing UserParameter do not return FAIL in case of timeout

 LATER:

 - setup demo site
 - add user groups
 - look for cool icons
 - different sound files for different severity
 - distributed monitoring
 - rename "Alerts" to "Notifications"
 - add numeric constants to trigger expressions
 - get rid of problems with ' and "
 - think about service node types (some nodes will automatically register
  problem)
 - restructure sources (no C files in include/, move some sources into lib, etc)
