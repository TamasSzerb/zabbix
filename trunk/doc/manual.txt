1.2 Acknowledgements

I want to thank guys from sourceforge.net for providing hosting for
the project. 

I also want to thank all the Zabbix users who have sent corrections and suggestions. 
This sort of feedback helps me make the software better.

1.3 What is Zabbix ?

Zabbix was created by Alexei Vladishev, (alex@gobbo.caves.lv).

Zabbix is software for monitoring various parameters of network and 
servers. Polling and trapping are supported. All monitored parameters are stored 
in Zabbix database.  It allows great reporting and data visualisation possibilities.
Additionally, Zabbix is useful tool for monitoring integrity of servers to avoid break-in
attempts.
Stored data is useful source of information for capacity planning.

Flexible notification mechanism allows to configure e-mail based alerms
for virtually any pre-defined events. The alarms help to prevent
possible problems before they actually happen.

Web-based frontend is used to provide fast and efficient way for Zabbix
configuration and administration.

Properly configured Zabbix can play most important role in monitoring of IT infrastructure
for companies with even hundreds of servers to monitor. 

The Zabbix software is free for use. However, if support is an issue for you,
that is an option as well. Please, contact alex@gobbo.caves.lv to get additional
information on available support levels. 

The latest version of Zabbix can be found at http://zabbix.sourceforge.net.

1.5 What does Zabbix offer ?

The following are amongst the features that Zabbix offer:

 - Support for both polling and traping mechanism
 - agents for Linux (HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD are coming soon)
 - server side is running under Linux (other UNIX variants to be supported soon)
 - user authorisation
 - two user groups: "Administrators" and "Zabbix users"
 - WEB-based interface
 - E-mail notification in case of predefined events

2. Chapter 2 (Use of Zabbix)

2.1 Performance monitoring

One of most important use of Zabbix is performance monitoring. Processor load, number of running processes,
number of processes, disk activity, status of wap space, memory availability  - that is only part
of system parameters Zabbix is able to monitor. Zabbix provides a system (e.g. database, an application) administrator
with latest information about performance of server being monitored.

2.2 Alarming users

Having performance monitoring is good, but it is almost useless without powerfull notification mechanism. Using Zabbix, 
you can define virtually any possible condition for a trigger. How ? Using flexible expressions !

Look, how it works.

Suppose, you wish to be notified when file /etc/passwd is changed by someone. You define
trigger with expression {sourceforge.net:cksum[/etc/passwd].diff(0)}>0. This expression becomes
true, when current value of checksum for /etc/passwd will be different with previously
gotten checksum.
Then, you define list of actions for the trigger. All you want is getting an Email about this event.
So, you add action for this trigger. When the trigger expression becomes true, you will get Email notification.

2.3 Integrity checking

Zabbix can easily be used for servers' integrity checking. All mission critical configuration files,
binaries, kernel, scripts, web server HTML pages can be monitored by Zabbix to be alarmed in case of any modifications
made on these files.

2.4 Logging services

All values of monitored parameters Zabbix stores in database. The collected data can be used later for any purposes.

2.5 Capacity planning

Looking at graph of process load (disk usage,database activity, ...)  for period of several weeks (or monthes), 
system administrator can clearly see when next hardware upgrade should be made.

3. Chapter 3 (Structure)

Zabbix has basically client-server architecture. Zabbix server periodically
gets most recent information of parameters for monitored host. It connects to 
an agent placed on the host, asks for specific information (for example, processor load). Agent
gives the information back to server and server, in its turn, stores received
value in the database.

It is also possible to use trapping method. In tis case, monitored host sends information
to Zabbix server.

3.1 zabbix_suckerd

The Zabbix server process.

SYNOPSIS

zabbix_suckerd

DESCRIPTION

The process periodically connects to agents (either Zabbix native or SNMP) to get updated information on parameters being
monitored.  Also, the process periodically re-calculates status of triggers. It sends alerts to users
if required.

By default, zabbix_suckerd forks ten copies of itself. It means that Zabbix will be able to get ten monitored parameters
simultaneously. Modify parameter SUCKER_FORKS in include/common.h if ten is not enough for you. 

No switches are supported by zabbix_suckerd.

The process is run as daemon under non-priveledged user account, usually zabbix. Syslog is used to store
debug information for the process.

3.2 zabbix_agent

The Zabbix agent (called from inetd).

SYNOPSIS

zabbix_agent

DESCRIPTION

The process lives on host being monitored. zabbix_agent provides requested information to 
zabbix_suckerd. zabbix_agent is made to be used with INETD daemon.

Execution time of the process is limited. If agent was not able to get information 
during 3 seconds, it kills himself. 

When connection to zabbix_agent is made, the agent reads /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent.conf file. This file should exist and contain
IP address of Zabbix server. Connections from other IPs are rejected.

If possible, use zabbix_agentd. It does not require extra fork() and exec() calls for every connection.

3.3 zabbix_agentd

Standalone Zabbix agent (daemon).

SYNOPSIS

zabbix_agentd

DESCRIPTION

The process runs on host being monitored. zabbix_agentd provides requested information to 
zabbix_suckerd. 

When executed, it forks himself. Load is balanced between each copy (dafault is ten).

When connection to zabbix_agentd is made, the agent reads /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent.conf file. This file should exist and contain
IP address of Zabbix server. Connections from other IPs are rejected.

No switches are supported by zabbix_agentd.

The process is run as daemon under non-priveledged user account, usually zabbix. Syslog is used to store
debug information for the process.

3.4 zabbix_trapper

The Zabbix server process.

SYNOPSIS

zabbix_trapper

DESCRIPTION

The process is made to support traping. It constantly waits for connections from zabbix_sender
agents.  

3.5 zabbix_sender

The Zabbix agent (trapping).

SYNOPSIS

zabbix_sender zabbix_server port host:key value

DESCRIPTION

The process, when executed, sends information to Zabbix.

	zabbix_server	Name or IP address of Zabbix server to connect.
	port		Port number to connect to Zabbix. It is port number of zabbix_trapper process.
	host:key	Host name and key for value.
	value		Value for parameter "host:key". Float number. 

EXAMPLE:

zabbix_sender zabbix.abcde.com 10001 db.abcde.com:procload 2.34

It means, that zabbix_sender will send information about processor load on host db.abcde.com
to Zabbix server located at zabbix.acbde.com. Processor load is 2.34.

3.6 Database

Database used by Zabbix play most important role. The database is the only source
of configuration parameters and it stores all history of monitored values.

Zabbix performance highly depends on officiency and speed of used database.
 
3.7 WEB-based frontend

The frontend provides convinient and platform independed way for accessing Zabbix.
Information provided by the frontend can be either graphical (e.g. graph on disk space
usage) or text format. Text representation of monitored parameters is made to allow
easy way for export Zabbix data to other analytical tools.

3.7.1 Reports

Zabbix reports represent collected information in structured way. All reports are produced
in HTML format.

Note that report generation could be very time consuming operation. Additionally, if you
use MySQL or ay other database with table locking, zabbix_suckerd and zabbix_trapper will
wait until the report is finished.

3.7.1.1 Status of Zabbix

This report gives general information about Zabbix server including:

 - number of records in most important tables
 - are main Zabbix processes running ?
 - other information

3.7.1.2 Availability report

This report calculates amount of time a trigger spent in true and false states. 

Suppose, you want to see this information for trigger "WEB server is down". You run this report and see
that the trigger was 0.005% in true state and 99.995 percent of time in false state. It means that
WEB server was unavailable 0.005 percent of time, and availability index is 0.005%. Pretty good !

4. Chapter 4 (Installation)

4.1 Requirements

Zabbix server processes support the following platforms:

 - Linux 2.xx
 - Support for HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD is coming soon

Zabbix agents are available for the following platforms:

 - Linux 2.xx
 - Support for HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD is coming soon

Zabbix requires the following software to run properly:

 - Apache 1.3.12 or later
 - Database engine
  - MySQL 3.22 or later
  or
  - PostgreSQL 7.0.2 or later
 - PHP 4.0 or later, compiled as Apache module with 
 	- GD module (for PNG images)
	- MySQL of PostgreSQL module
 - GNU make
 - WEB browser on client side (support for HTML and PNG images required). MS Explorer and Netscape work perfectly.
 - UCD-SNMP library and header files. Required for support of SNMP agents. Optional.

However, Zabbix can work on previous versions of Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL as well.

Debian Potato and Debian Woody are development and testing platforms I currently use.

I've tried to run Zabbix on PostgreSQL 6.5x with no luck. PostgreSQL crashes after
one-tree minutes of zabbix_suckerd running. So, PostgreSQL version 7.0.2 or later is strongly
recommended.


Choosing between PostgreSQL and MySQL, I would go for MySQL + InnoDB. Why ? Several reasons exist:

- my recent benchmarks clearly show that PostgreSQL (7.1.x) works at least 10 times slower than MySQL (3.23.29)
- MySQL MyISAM table is not good choise because of lack of row locking. So, InnoDB is required
- no need to constantly run "vacuum" command for MySQL

Memory requirements:

Zabbix requires both physical (suprise!) and disk memory. 32 Mb of physical 
memory and 20 Mb of free disk memory could be good start point.
However, amount of required disk memory strongly depends on used configuration 
parameters. If you're planning to keep long history of monitored parameters, 
you should think of even a couple of gigabytes to have enough space to store the history in 
the database.

Remember, the more physical memory you have, the faster database and Zabbix works !

4.2 Installation procedure

Basic installation of Zabbix usually takes no more than 15 minutes. However, to make
process more enjoyable, I would suggest to make cup of tea (or coffee) for yourself.
Ready ? Let us start ...

4.2.1 Create the Zabbix superuser account: 

This is the user the server will run on.  For production use you should create 
a separate, unprivileged account ("zabbix" is commonly used).

Running Zabbix as "root","bin", or any other account with special rights is a 
security risk. Do not do it ! 


4.2.2 Untar Zabbix sources:

On Linux, use command tar -xvzf <zabbix.tar.gz>


4.2.3 Create the Zabbix database:

For MySQL:

mysql -u<username> -p<password>
> create database zabbix;
>quit;

cd create/mysql
cat schema.sql |mysql zabbix -u<username> -p<password>
cd create/data
cat data.sql |mysql zabbix -u<username> -p<password>

For PostgreSQL:

psql -U <username>
> create database zabbix;
> \q

cd create/postgresql
cat schema.sql|psql -U <username> zabbix
cd create/data
cat data.sql|psql -U <username> zabbix


4.2.4 Configure include/db.h

Change the following parameters:

#define DB_NAME         "zabbix"
#define DB_USER         "zabbix"
#define DB_PASSWD       "password"

4.2.5 Configure and compile the source code for your system.

./configure --with-mysql  # for MySQL
 or
./configure --with-pgsql  # for PostgreSQL
make

If you want to compile client binaries only, run:

./configure
make

4.2.6 Copy created binaries from bin/ to /opt/zabbix/bin or any other directory. 

4.2.7 Configure /etc/services

Add the following lines to /etc/services:

zabbix_agent    10000/tcp
zabbix_trap     10001/tcp 

4.2.8 Configure /etc/inetd.conf

Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf:

zabbix_trap         stream  tcp     nowait.3600    zabbix /opt/zabbix/bin/zabbix_trapper

If you plan to use zabbix_agent (zabbix_agentd does not require this!), the following line must be added:

zabbix_agent        stream  tcp     nowait.3600    zabbix /opt/zabbix/bin/zabbix_agent


4.2.9 Restart inetd

killall -HUP inetd

4.2.10 Configure WEB interface

As zabbix:

Change these values in frontends/php/include/db.inc:
        $DB_TYPE        ="POSTGRESQL"; /* Or "MYSQL" for MySQL */
        $DB_SERVER      ="localhost";
        $DB_DATABASE    ="zabbix";
        $DB_USER        ="";
        $DB_PWD         =""

mkdir /home/zabbix/html
cp -R frontends/php/* /home/zabbix/html/

4.2.11 Configure Apache

By default, Apache does not recognize *.html files as PHP scripts. Add the following
line to Apache configuration files to make Apache think that every *.html file
is actually PHP script that should be interpreted:

AddType application/x-httpd-php .html

4.2.12 Configure /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent.conf

You need to configure this file for every host having zabbix_agent installed.
The file should contain IP address of Zabbix server. Connections from other
hosts will be denied.

5. Chapter 5 (Administration)

5.1 Zabbix configuration

 - Use WEB browser to configure Zabbix (http://localhost/~zabbix)
 - Click on "CONFIG"

Enter "Admin" as login name and leave password field empty.

Set up SMTP parameters. 

 - Click on "USERS"

Add yourself to list of Zabbix users. Do not forget to select "Administrators" group.

Delete default "Admin" user.

 - Set up available Medias for the user (Click on "Media")

 - Add host for monitoring

Be sure that you've installed agent on the host. Otherwise, set status
to "Not monitored". List of possible parameers for the host will be automatically added.

 - Configure ITEMS

 - Configure TRIGGERS

 - Run zabbix_suckerd

/opt/zabbix/bin/zabbix_suckerd

 - Run zabbix_agentd

You should not run zabbix_agentd this if you use zabbix_agent !

Define actions for triggers you are interested in. Note, that you can always use
macros in both email subject and email body. 
For example, subject for warning message could look like:

Processor load on www.sf.net is {www.sf.net:system[procload].last(0)}

In this case, you will receive message with subject like "Processor load on www.sf.net is 0.85".

- Create at least one Network Map

The map will greately help you quickly identify where a problem is.

5.2 Expressions for triggers

The following operators supported for triggers:

> - more than
< - less than
| - logical OR
& - logical AND

The following functions supported:

last	- last value, parameter is ignored 
min	- MIN value for period of time, parameter - time in sec
max	- MAX value for period of time, parameter - time in sec
diff	- 1 - if last and previous values are different, 0 - otherwise
prev	- previous value, parameter is ignored

Simplest useful expression might look as:

{<server>:<key>.<function>(<parameter>)}<operator><const>

Example 1:

{sourceforge.net:procload.last(0)}>5

It means:

sourceforge.net - server name
procload	- key name

sourceforge.net:procload gives short name of monitored parameter.

last		- function name

Basically the expression means, processor load of sourceforge.net is more than
5. The trigger becomes true, when processor load exceeds 5. 

Example 2:

More complex example:

({sourceforge.net:system[procload].last(0)}>5) | ({sourceforge.net:system[procload].min(600)}>2)

The expression becomes true when either current processor load is more
than 5 or it was more than 2 during last 10 minutes.

Example 3:

Use of diff function.

({sourceforge.net:cksum[/etc/passwd].diff(0)})>0

The expression becomes true when previous value of checksum of /etc/passwd
differs from last one.

Similiar expressions could be useful to monitor changes in important files, such as
/etc/passwd, /etc/inetd.conf, /kernel, etc.

6. Chapter 6 (Upgrading)

Upgrade procedure is quite simple. New binaries and frontend
should be installed according to latest installation guide.

In order to update database structure, the following steps
should be performed. Note that before applying database patches,
all Zabbix processes must be stopped. Also, the process can take
from 0 seconds (if no patches required) up to several hours. 

For business-critical installations database backup is required !

Step 1. cd upgrades/dbpatches/
Step 2. In case, if you need to upgrade existing 1.0alpha3 version to 1.0alpha4 version. 
	cd 1.0alpha3_to_1.0alpha4/
	(If you jump throw several Zabbix versions, for example, from 1.0alpha1 to 1.0.alpha5, all patches between 1.0alpha1 and 1.0alpha5 must be applied)
Step 3. Depending on your database engine:

	cd mysql
	cat patch.sql |mysql zabbix -u<username> -p<password>

	or

	cd postgresql
	cat patch.sql|psql -U <username> zabbix

Step 4. Read version-specific notes in this chapter.

That is all. Zabbix database is ready. Start Zabbix server processes using usual procedure. 

6.1 Zabbix 1.0alpha8

 - Note that zabbix_sucker renamed to zabbix_suckerd

 - Replace zabbix_agent with zabbix_agentd

zabbix_agentd runs much faster than 'old' zabbix_agent. Moreover, if
you do not run inetd, zabbix_agentd is the only choice :)

 - PostgreSQL notes.

PostgreSQL does not support modifying of structure of table field.
Thus, please, change definition of the following fields (MySQL code):

alter table users modify passwd char(32) default '' not null;
alter table actions modify message text default '' not null;
alter table alerts modify message text default '' not null;

 - Try to use IP address in host definition

This unloads DNS and makes zabbix_suckerd faster.

6.2 Zabbix 1.0alpha9

Do not forget to install DB patches.

7. Chapter 7 (Misc)

7.1 pinger.pl

The script is used to periodically sind ICMP pings to list of servers. In case, if it does
not receive responce from host, it executes:

zabbix_sender <server> <port> <host>:alive 0

otherwise:

zabbix_sender <server> <port> <host>:alive 1

The script is usually called from cron. Configure the script before use. Change location for "hosts"
file. You must have fping installed to successfully run the script.

7.2 PostgreSQL notes

Performance of PostgreSQL can be significantly improved by executing
VACUUM command on Zabbix database.

I would suggest execute VACUUM, at least, after the following events:

 - Zabbix is installed
 - 10000 records in table "history"
 - patches applied on Zabbix database

For heavy loaded Zabbix servers, hourly execution of "VACUUM ANALYZE" for all tables except "history"
is strongly recommended !

Command:

echo "vacuum verbose analyze"|psql zabbix
