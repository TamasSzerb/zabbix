II. Win32-specific parameters
                             
cpu_util		Average CPU(s) utilization (in percents) for
                        last minute
cpu_util5		Average CPU(s) utilization (in percents) for
                        last 5 minutes
cpu_util15		Average CPU(s) utilization (in percents) for
                        last 15 minutes
cpu_util[<instance>]	Average specific CPU utilization (in percents) for last
                        minute, where <instance> is zero-based CPU number
cpu_util5[<instance>]	Average specific CPU utilization (in percents) for last
                        5 minutes, where <instance> is zero-based CPU number
cpu_util15[<instance>]	Average specific CPU utilization (in percents) for last
                        15 minutes, where <instance> is zero-based CPU number
perf_counter[<path>]    Value of any performance counter, where <path> is the 
			counter path (you can use Performance Monitor to obtain
			list of available counters). Please note that this
			parameter will return correct value only for counters
			which requires just one sample (like "\System\Threads").
			It will not work as expected for counters that requires
			more than one sample - like CPU utilization.
service_state[<srv>]	State of service <srv>. The following states can be
         		returned:
			   0 - Running
			   1 - Paused
			   2 - Start pending
			   3 - Pause pending
			   4 - Continue pending
			   5 - Stop pending
			   6 - Stopped
			   7 - Unknown
			 255 - SCM communication error
			Please note that <srv> should be real service name (as
			it seen in service properties under "Name:"), not
			service display name!
